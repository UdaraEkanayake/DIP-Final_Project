# DIP-Final_Project
This is a vehicle damage detection application (Technologies used : Deep learning,DIP libraries,Python)

##Vehicle Damage Detection and Assessment System
This project aims to develop an automated system for detecting and assessing vehicle damage using image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms. The system analyzes images of damaged vehicles, identifies the type and extent of damage, and provides a preliminary estimate for repair costs. It can be used in insurance claims processing, vehicle maintenance, and other related applications.
